function [modWeights,modBias] = rearrangeONNXWeights(weights,bias,numAnchorBoxes)
%rearrangeONNXWeights rearranges the weights and biases of an imported YOLO
%v2 network as required by yolov2ObjectDetector. numAnchorBoxes is a scalar
%value containing the number of anchors that are used to reorder the weights and
%biases. This function performs the following operations:
%   * Extract the weights and biases related to IoU, boxes, and classes.
%   * Reorder the extracted weights and biases as expected by yolov2ObjectDetector.
%   * Combine and reshape them back to the original dimensions.

weightsSize = size(weights);
biasSize = size(bias);
sizeOfPredictions = biasSize(3)/numAnchorBoxes;

% Reshape the weights with regard to the size of the predictions and anchors.
reshapedWeights = reshape(weights,prod(weightsSize(1:3)),sizeOfPredictions,numAnchorBoxes);

% Extract the weights related to IoU, boxes, and classes.
weightsIou = reshapedWeights(:,5,:);
weightsBoxes = reshapedWeights(:,1:4,:);
weightsClasses = reshapedWeights(:,6:end,:);

% Combine the weights of the extracted parameters as required by
% yolov2ObjectDetector.
reorderedWeights = cat(2,weightsIou,weightsBoxes,weightsClasses);
permutedWeights = permute(reorderedWeights,[1 3 2]);

% Reshape the new weights to the original size.
modWeights = reshape(permutedWeights,weightsSize);

% Reshape the biases with regared to the size of the predictions and anchors.
reshapedBias = reshape(bias,sizeOfPredictions,numAnchorBoxes);

% Extract the biases related to IoU, boxes, and classes.
biasIou = reshapedBias(5,:);
biasBoxes = reshapedBias(1:4,:);
biasClasses = reshapedBias(6:end,:);

% Combine the biases of the extracted parameters as required by yolov2ObjectDetector.
reorderedBias = cat(1,biasIou,biasBoxes,biasClasses);
permutedBias = permute(reorderedBias,[2 1]);

% Reshape the new biases to the original size.
